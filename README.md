Code and 3D Model is open BUT does NOT mean you can reupload this to the Workshop even with some small changes!
However if you think your changes are big enough: ask me for permission, like i did asking the original TTT Thomas Autor.
3D Model can be used for your Addons no problem :D just show me your work and mention me in the Credits.
