You can use the 3D Model and Code for your unique and diffrent Addon! (just send me a link and mention me in The Credits <3 )
BUT I dont want to see slightly modified Versions of this Addon on the Workshop! I can provide Custom ConVars for any small changes you need, or you just edit the Lua on your Server
However if you think your modifications are big enough for a separate Workshop upload: ask me for permission, like i did asking the original TTT Thomas Autor. And tell me what is so diffrent that we cant include it in this addons Code. I am likely to say yes don't worry <3
